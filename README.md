Project Overview
This project predicts medical insurance charges using a linear regression model. It demonstrates the typical
supervised‑learning workflow: data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, model training,
evaluation, and visualization — all implemented in a Jupyter notebook.
Notebook (source): /mnt/data/medical-insurance-cost-with-linear-regression.ipynb
Contents
medical-insurance-cost-with-linear-regression.ipynb — Jupyter notebook with full
code, explanations, and plots.
requirements.txt (recommended) — Python dependencies used for the project.
Dataset
The notebook expects the medical insurance dataset (commonly available as insurance.csv ) which
contains columns such as:
age — age of primary beneficiary
sex — gender
bmi — body mass index
children — number of children covered by health insurance
smoker — whether the person smokes
region — residential area
charges — individual medical costs billed by health insurance
If the notebook already includes the dataset or loads it from a path, follow the code in the notebook.
Otherwise, place insurance.csv in the same folder as the notebook or update the path in the notebook.
Main Steps (in notebook)
Load data — read CSV into a pandas DataFrame.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) — inspect distributions, correlations, and relationships between
features and the target ( charges ).
Preprocessing — handle categorical features (one‑hot encoding or label encoding), scale numerical
features if required, and split into train/test sets.
Modeling — build and train a linear regression model (scikit‑learn LinearRegression ) and
potentially compare with baseline models.
Evaluation — compute metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root
MSE (RMSE), and R² score. Visualize predicted vs actual charges.
Conclusion & Next steps — summarize findings and suggest improvements (feature engineering,
regularization, alternate models such as Ridge/Lasso/Tree‑based models).

jupyter
Open and run the notebook:
jupyter notebook medical-insurance-cost-with-linear-regression.ipynb
Or execute the notebook headlessly:
jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute medical-insurance-cost-with-linearregression.ipynb --output executed_notebook.ipynb
Results & Interpretation
The notebook contains model performance metrics and plots. Look for the evaluation section (MAE, RMSE,
R²) and visualizations such as predicted vs actual scatter plots to understand model quality. Linear
regression provides a simple, interpretable baseline — review residuals and consider more complex models
if performance is insufficient.
Suggestions for improvement
Try regularized linear models (Ridge, Lasso) to reduce overfitting.
Engineer interaction terms (e.g., bmi * smoker ) or polynomial features for non‑linear effects.
Evaluate tree‑based models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) for potentially better
performance.
Use cross‑validation for more robust performance estimates.
Add unit tests / data validation steps to safeguard data quality.
